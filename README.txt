This is an Autopsy plugin meant to faciliate the viewing of text messages found on an Android device image.  It works by parsing the mmssms.db file and matching messages based on common participants--these messages are then ordered by timestamp and output as a transcript in an Autopsy report.

To run, download the source code and place it in the python_modules folder in Autopsy.  You can then open Autopsy and go to 'Generate Report', where the 'Conversation Identifer & Extractor' report should be available.  Selecting this generates a conversation report.
